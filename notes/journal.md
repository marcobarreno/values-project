## 2026-10-02 — Project plan

**Goal.** Create a plan of record that goes from a cheap proof of concept to reproducing several of the paper's key results.

**What we did.** Wrote [`docs/project_plan.md`](../docs/project_plan.md):
- six phases: infrastructure; §3.1 eval with the released adapters; §3.1 training (a 1-seed proof of concept, then 6 arms × 4 seeds); the data-generation pipeline; §4 agentic misalignment (eval-only on released adapters first, training as a decision point); optional further eval-only results;
- a sequencing table and an appendix on what the paper did and didn't release.

Repointed the README, `CLAUDE.md` and the `msm_repro` README at the new plan.

**Decisions.**
- **No fixed overall budget.** Every phase has a rough cost estimate and an explicit go/no-go gate.
- **Dev/test split of the §3.1 eval sets.** The first approach we considered was to pick the eval protocol (decoding, option-order swap, parser) by whichever setting reproduced Fig. 2 on the full eval sets, which amounts to tuning on the test set. The protocol will instead be chosen on a ~25% dev split and frozen before the test split is used.
- **Reduced AM grid.** The §4 eval on released adapters uses all 27 conditions at ~30 samples each instead of 300. The reported effect (68% → 5%) is large enough that this gives a standard error of roughly 1.5–2pp per arm, at about a tenth of the grading cost.
- **Extensions left TBD** until the reproduction phases have results.

**Open questions.**
- All cost figures are pre-measurement estimates. Phase 2a will replace the GPU estimates with measured throughput, and grading costs need checking against current API pricing before Phase 4a.
